> **25 Jan 2020**: Let's start! So the aim of this project is to practice with **Playwright** framework and build sample POC project. I'll use this diary to catch my thoughts/findings/conclusions. Ok, what I want to try:
>
> - try different test runners for JS: Mocha, Jest, etc.
> - cross-browser UI automation with mobile emulation
> - determne page-objects / test structure for **JS** projects
> - HTTP/S Request mocking using mockiabelli
> - **GitHub Actions** as CI
> - Try **Azure Pipelines**
> - run tests in **minikube** or **Moon**
>
> as a result, we should receive sample project, which can be used as a reference for quick-start.

> Found cool readme at QAWolf repo. Need to check how they're using images etc. - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qawolf/qawolf/develop/README.md 

> Hm...they also have playwright-video - https://github.com/qawolf/playwright-video. Need to check if playwight can do it out-of-the-box or I need to use their plugin
